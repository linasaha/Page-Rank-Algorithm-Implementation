# Page-Rank-Algorithm-Implementation
PageRank algorithm can be used to rank nodes in a graph in order of their importance.

Computed the page rank of each node (airport) based on number of inlinks and outlinks.
There may be multiple connections between two airports, and it is considered independent of each other to compute the number of inlinks and outlinks.
